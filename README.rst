SHell command MOCK (SHMOCK)
===========================

Purpose
-------

Tools for system administration typically call lots of programs on the command line. This makes automated testing quite tricky, since you may need to

* run "sudo ....", even though the build system is not allowed to use sudo
* have tools like "uname" or "ifconfig" produce certain output for testing

shmock helps you by creating mock commands that supersede the system's own commands due to a temporarily manipulated $PATH. Based on the command line parameters, mock commands can have different

* output on STDOUT and STDERR
* exit code

It is not possible to simulate slowness or commands that behave differently the second time you call them. Command line parsing is very limited, but that's not a problem for auto-generated calls. However, these limitations make the implementation very simple.


Configuration
-------------

To configure which commands should be mocked (and how), use a dictionary like this:

.. code-block:: python

    commands_to_mock = {
        'saynay': 'Nay sayers say nay.',
        'jonny': {
            (): "walker",
            "foo": "bar",
            ("b", "goode"): "Go, Jonny, go!",
            ("be", "bad"): {"stderr": "yup", "returncode": 255},
            None: {
                "stdout": "You called me with some unknown parameters.",
                "stderr": "And I don't like that.",
                "returncode": 1
            }
        }
    }

The first part uses the most simple way of defining a mocked command: A 'saynay' command is defined that always prints "Nay sayers say nay." and exits successfully, regardless of command line options.

After that, a 'jonny' command is defined that illustrates the full feature set of the shmock module. The command is defined to

* When called with no parameters, print "walker".
* When called with a single parameter "foo", print "bar".
* When called with the two parameters "b" and "goode", print "Go, Jonny, go!".
* When called with "be bad", print "yup" to standard error and then exit with 255.
* When called with any other parameters, print "You..." to standard out, print "And..." to standard error and then exit with 1.

Usage
-----

The ShellCommandMock is intended to be used in "with" contexts as shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from shmock import ShellCommandMock
    with ShellCommandMock(commands_to_mock):
        os.system("echo $PATH")

        os.system("jonny")
        os.system("jonny b goode")
        os.system("jonny be bad")
        os.system("jonny foobar")

    os.system("echo $PATH")

Advanced Usage
--------------

Sometimes you want to keep the mocked shell commands for further testing/debugging. You can tell shmock to not clean up the mock environment with

.. code-block:: python

    from shmock import ShellCommandMock
    with ShellCommandMock(commands_to_mock, keep_temp_dir=True):
        pass

shmock will print the location of the mock environment, so that you can add it to you $PATH.

When output is printed, shmock calls print(), and print() automatically appends a newline to the output. As a result, it is currently not possible to produce output that does not end in a newline. This will be fixed once it becomes a problem.
